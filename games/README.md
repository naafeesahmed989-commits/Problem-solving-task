## python games:

1) Guessing game:
I learned how to build a small game using a simple and clear structure that feels like reading natural language. I understood how a while loop works with a condition to limit the number of attempts. I learned that a while loop can have an else part, which runs when the user runs out of attempts. I learned how break stops the loop immediately when the correct guess is made.

2) car game:
I learned how to use a while loop to keep the program running until the user chooses to quit. I practiced taking user input and responding to different commands. I understood nested if statements and how to use them properly. I learned the DRY principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself), which is why I used .lower() only once instead of multiple times.
