# Problem-Solving Task

This is a small coding exercise to improve my problem-solving skills in Python. 
**The goal** of this task was to remove duplicates from a list while thinking critically about the logic, rather than just writing code without understanding. 

It helped me practice:
1)Loops (`for`)
2)Conditional statements (`if`)
3)List operations (`append()`, `in`, `not in`)
4)Thinking step by step to solve problems
